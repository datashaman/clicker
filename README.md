# clicker

Generic clicker. Initial build borrows _heavily_ from *cookieclicker*; once I've got the basic building blocks done, I'll make it more unique.

Roadmap:

* ~add upgrades~
* ~abstract config into a theme file~
* add achievements
* add permanent upgrades
* add production counter (current run and all time) overall
* add production counter per building type (current run only)
* add current run time - uptime in default theme?
* add theme switcher
* add various themes, some ideas below:
  * alchemy
  * fantasy rpg
  * healthcare (covid-19?)
  * magic
  * sci-fi
* add endgame scenarios, some ideas below:
  * the singularity
  * heat death of the universe
* add random distraction / rewards
* easter eggs (as many as possible)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
